# Phase_control_fluid_flow

This is a repository containing MATLAB codes for the preprint:"Phase-based control of periodic fluid flows" by Aditya G. Nair, Kunihiko Taira, Bingni W. Brunton and Steven L. Brunton

Phase_optimal_control.m: Contains main script for optimal phase-based control.

Data: Contains numerical data (phase-sensitivity function and gradients) for cylinder flow at Re = 100 and flow over an airfoil at Re = 1000.
